### Acknowledgements ###

Thanks to Erik for :
(i) offering a PhD project with a lot of potential
(ii) keeping is door always open for small questions
(iii) he did a great job at leading me through the scientific and social challenges involved in a PhD

But he was not alone in doing so, I had a large PhD committe that adviced me on yearly meetings and random encounters
it consisted of
Lukas Keller
Barbara Tschirren
Arpat Ozgul
Marc KÃ©ry 
Jarrod Hadfield
thanks to them for scientific support but also for being always supportive and encouraging 

Then, today I am presenting my work in the PhD,
but I could not stress enough that everything you will see is also the result of the work of others
(i) in particular many thanks to Glauco Camenisch for considerable help on the field, in the lab and with computers
(ii) Second, thanks to Koen van Benthem for taking the lead and taking care of the most complicated bits of the paper we wrote together with Marjolein, Eelke, Arpat and Erik.
(iii) For one year and a half, it my pleasure to work with Andres Hagmayer who did is master with us. He made possible some crazy experiments, learned a lot of complicated stuff and taught me a lot about teaching.
(iv)Field work was a significant part of my work, a very enjoyable part, but also a tough one, I could count on the awesome help of Dominique, Martina, Vicente, Simon... and many others

I am afraid I don't have time to thank half of those who deserve it half as much as they deserve it, 
so, a huge shared thank you to the Zurich folks with who I shared scientific discussions, journal clubs, coffees, excursions and beers.
they made my stay here very pleasant and enriching


# Same slide
Looking at these people, you might realize that they are all very different
some are blond, some are dark-haired
some are tall, some are short
some are serious looking, some like to have funny faces


Why is that? 

Very complicated question. They ate different food, had different exposure to sun, did more or less physical activities, had different parents...
The number of factors making us who we are is tremendous and it seems hopeless to try and disentangle them all. 

Now if we forget these humans and look at other organisms, one can ask the same question

Phenotypic variation in size / color morphes 
Survival and fertility variation 


Why are individuals within a population different ?
The question is a long lasting one, 


However, what we can do is to make groups of factors that do not behave in the same way and leave different type of prints in the variation among individuals.



### Why are individuals different ? ###
# The problem explained with dice
So, why individuals differ in some trait is a very complicated question because there can be a lot of factors contributing to differences
And you can think that the more complicated the trait, the more it is difficult to disentangle all the causes of variation.
So called life-history traits, for instance survival and reproductive success are among the most complicated traits, 
because they depend themselves on many other traits as well as on unpredictable environmental factors.
Thus, example mortality: depend on not carrying a lethal genetic disease, on living in a suitable habitat that provides abundance of food and few predators, but there can always be unpredictable accidents such as a meteoritic impact.
That is why we can think about life-history traits as a stochastic process. 

Imagine that we consider the annual reproductive success of some animal; every year, each individual is likely to produce a different number of offsrping
and a reasonable first model for how this work would be a die:



# The neutral case

# Power problem -> mixed models better

# Heritability solves the question. 

#### Wait, why are we interested in that? Why do we want to know ? ####

On contemporary evolution, environmental changes, understanding of responses, prediction
Rate of evolution = heritability fitness

So studying the causes of variation in fitness is also studying its consequences or the other way around. 

-> persistence => selection ; -> heritability => evolutionary potential


### How do we disentangle changes in a population into evolution / plasticity components ? ####



### Intro snow vole and its monitoring ###

### Snow vole contemporary evolution ###


### The temporal dynamic of selection and evolution ###


### Ways to go further? ###
