### Acknowledgements ###

Thanks to Erik for :
(i) offering a PhD project with a lot of potential
(ii) keeping is door always open for small questions
(iii) he did a great job at leading me through the scientific and social challenges involved in a PhD

But he was not alone in doing so, I had a large PhD committe that adviced me on yearly meetings and random encounters
it consisted of
Lukas Keller
Barbara Tschirren
Arpat Ozgul
Marc KÃ©ry 
Jarrod Hadfield
thanks to them for scientific support but also for being always supportive and encouraging 

Then, today I am presenting my work in the PhD,
but I could not stress enough that everything you will see is also the result of the work of others
(i) in particular many thanks to Glauco Camenisch for considerable help on the field, in the lab and with computers
(ii) Second, thanks to Koen van Benthem for taking the lead and taking care of the most complicated bits of the paper we wrote together with Marjolein, Eelke, Arpat and Erik.
(iii) For one year and a half, it my pleasure to work with Andres Hagmayer who did is master with us. He made possible some crazy experiments, learned a lot of complicated stuff and taught me a lot about teaching.
(iv)Field work was a significant part of my work, a very enjoyable part, but also a tough one, I could count on the awesome help of Dominique, Martina, Vicente, Simon... and many others

I am afraid I don't have time to thank half of those who deserve it half as much as they deserve it, 
so, a huge shared thank you to the Zurich folks with who I shared scientific discussions, journal clubs, coffees, excursions and beers.
they made my stay here very pleasant and enriching
