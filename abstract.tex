\begin{summary}
\textbf{
This thesis investigates the stochastic and selective causes of variation in fitness components, and the evolutionary consequences of this variation in a wild rodent population. 
Thus, it shows the contemporary genetic evolution of body mass and the uncoupling between estimates of selection and evolution.

In this thesis, 

I begin by introducing the ideas of variation and fitness, and show their central role in evolutionary biology (Chapter \ref{chap:intro}). I illustrate the convenience of quantitative genetic methods to understand the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations by contrasting it with a candidate gene approach.
 

Chapter 

In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates contemporary evolution in a wild population and shows that evolutionary responses to environmental changes cannot be understood from purely phenotypic methods, an explicit genetic approach is necessary.
